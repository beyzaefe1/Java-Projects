## **Minutes**

Discussed project ideas:

Constellation identifier tool (smartphone app)

Terrain data to minecraft map coversion tool

Some kind of discord bot

Will probably use agile development, though this is not set in stone

Additional project discussion -

If using C++:

Expand the professor's Craft game? Could also do the terrain conversion tool using this instead of actual Minecraft. Uses GLFW. Everyone in the group knows C++.

If using Unity:

Make our own minecraft clone in unity?

Improved houseflipper style game?

Some kind of sensor system - unity for medical applications? Might be difficult due to needing physical hardware.

Unity stuff looks good on a resume.
